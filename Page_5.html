There are many issues with innapropriate behaviour online, being potentially damaging to the employee and as well as the company consequently,
it is imperative to be careful with what is posted online.</p>


<br><strong>Quote</strong>

<p><em>"Potentially damaging activities range from sharing confidential information, infringing on customer privacy and cyber bullying to posting comments
 which can be perceived as discriminatory or inappropriate, these actions elicit consequences
– for both employee and employer." </em> (Kay Vittee, 2017)</p>

<p><em>"Having a generally negative tone on social media is the biggest faux pas to human resources managers, the study showed.
The research found that 45 percent of those in charge of hiring
said they look down the most on job candidates who have a history of writing negative or inappropriate comments on social media." </em> (Chad Brooks, 2016)</p>

<strong>Content</strong>

<p>Allowing employees to access social media platforms at work, makes your organisation more vulnerable to potential breaches
in confidentiality or a possible tarnished image. Your staff may carelessly post tweets or updates regarding promotions or other business
information that the company might not be ready yet to release. Constant leaks of information can happen and are a common problem by
sharing confidential information with the wrong people through social media.</p>

<p>When creating and implementing your company’s social media policies make sure to consider all the advantages and disadvantages during office hours.
Taking into consideration the proliferation of smartphones, a complete ban may be less effective than having clear guidelines on moderate use.</p>
