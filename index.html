their employers’ entitlement to have their reputations protected." Mark O'Connell, 2015</em>

<br><h2>What is Social Media?</h2>

<p>Tufts University argues social media refers to the means of interactions among people in which they create, share, and/or exchange information and ideas in
  virtual communities and networks.</p>

<strong>Key Principles for Social Media Managers:</strong>

  <p>Social media is about conversations, community, connecting with the audience and building relationships.
    It is not just a broadcast channel or a sales and marketing tool.
    Authenticity, honesty and open dialogue are key.
    Social media not only allows you to hear what people say about you, but enables you to respond. Listen first, speak second.
    Be compelling, useful, relevant and engaging. Don’t be afraid to try new things, but think through your efforts before kicking them off.</p>

<strong>Popular Social Media Tools and Platforms:</strong>

<ul>
<li> Blogs: A platform for casual dialogue and discussions on a specific topic or opinion.</li>
<li>Facebook: The world’s largest social network, with more than 1.55 billion monthly active users (as of the third quarter of 2015). Users create a personal
profile, add other users as friends, and exchange messages, including status updates.
Brands create pages and Facebook users can “like” brands’ pages.</li>
<li>Twitter: A social networking/micro-blogging platform that allows groups and individuals to stay connected through the
exchange of short status messages (140 character limit).</li>
<li>YouTube & Vimeo: Video hosting and watching websites.</li>
<li>Flickr: An image and video hosting website and online community. Photos can be shared on Facebook and Twitter and other social networking sites.</li>
<li>Instagram: A free photo and video sharing app that allows users to apply digital filters, frames and special effects to
      their photos and then share them on a variety of social networking sites.</li>
<li>Snapchat: A mobile app that lets users send photos and videos to friends or to their “story.”
      Snaps disappear after viewing or after 24 hours. </li>

</ul>
