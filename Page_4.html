<h2>Other: Benefits of Social Media</h2>

<strong>Notes from Author</strong>

<p> Social media in summary has plenty of benefits encouraging professional networking, opportunities for marketing and brand loyalty among others.
Therefore it is clear that without social media these low cost benefits would be lost to the business,
careful consideration therefore has to be taken regarding what policies are implemented, I will discuss these on <a href="Page_8.html">Workplace Policies.</a>

<strong>Quote</strong>

<em>"Social Media sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and even Instagram are becoming the part of a modern workerâ€™s every day life.
These tools are no longer just for personal use since many people use them in their professional lives as well.
In the workplace, these social sites are being used for purposes such as marketing, employer branding, and corporate social responsibility;
recruiters use LinkedIn to find and connect with candidates, and many employees use Google + for the chat feature to connect instantly with colleagues
or conduct Hangouts." </em> (Kabalkin, 2015)
