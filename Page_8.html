  <h2>Workplace Policies</h2>

  <strong>Notes from Author</strong>
  <p>Hopefully this website has been useful to you in terms of your understanding of social media benefits and drawbacks. This final page is dedicated into using the knowledge
  we have learnt from the previous slides into creating coherant and applicable policys that can be used to effectively monitor employees. Effective social media
policy allows you to have the best of both worlds, limiting the posibility for negative outcomes whilst retaining positive ones.</p>

<br><strong>Quote</strong>

  <p><em>"The line between companies and their employees on social media is steadily blurring. Organizations today need a social media policy that at once
  helps keep the brand’s reputation intact while also encourages employee participation online.

  In this guide, we’ll layout the benefits of having a social media policy and give you all the information you need to create your own.
  We’ll also offer up a few good examples of policies from recognizable brands that you can draw inspiration from.""</em> (Russel, 2017)</p>

  <h3>Legal considerations</h3>

  <em>The Human Rights Act 1998</em> Article 8 gives a 'right to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence'. Case law suggests that employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the workplace.

  <br><em>The Data Protection Act 1988</em> covers how information about employees and job applicants can be collected, handled and used. The Information Commissioner's Office has published an employment practices code to help employers comply with the law.

  <em>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</em> covers the extent to which organisations can use covert surveillance.

<br>

  <strong>Action for employees</strong>

  Employees should regularly check the privacy settings on their social networking sites, they should consider whether they want or need co-workers to see their profiles.

<br>

  <strong>Developing a policy</strong>

  Employers should develop a policy setting out what is and what is not acceptable behaviour at work when using the internet, emails, smart phones, and networking websites. The policy should also give clear guidelines for employees on what they can and cannot say about the organisation. Any policy should be clear throughout about the distinction between business and private use of social media. If it allows limited private use in the workplace, it should be clear what this means in practice.

  In working out a policy for use of social media, the employer, staff and unions or staff reps (if there are any) should agree the details. The policy should aim to ensure: employees do not feel gagged; staff and managers feel protected against online bullying; and the organisation feels confident its reputation will be guarded.
<br>
  <br><strong>Disciplinary procedures</strong>
  An employer should try to apply the same standards of conduct in online matters as it would in offline issues.

  To help an organisation respond reasonably, the employer should consider the nature of the comments made and their likely impact on the organisation. It would help if the employer gives examples of what might be classed as 'defamation' and the penalties it would impose. The employer should also be clear in outlining what is regarded as confidential in the organisation.
<br>
  <br><strong>Blogging and tweeting</strong>
  If an employee is representing the company online, set appropriate rules for what information they may disclose and the range of opinions they may express. Bring to their attention relevant legislation on copyright and public interest disclosure.

  Some rules should be included on the use of social media in recruitment, which managers and employees should follow. When recruiting, employers should be careful if assessing applicants by looking at their social networking pages - this can be discriminatory and unfair.
<br>
  <br><strong>Update other policies</strong>
  For example, an organisation's policy on bullying should include references to 'cyber bullying'.

  Employers should inform and consult with their employees if planning to monitor social media activity affecting the workplace.
