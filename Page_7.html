<strong>Employee Productivity</strong>
According to a study by Nucleus Research, companies that allow employees to use Facebook during the work day lose 1.5 percent productivity.
With its wealth of applications, games and status updates, employees may find themselves compulsively checking Facebook throughout the day instead of performing
work-related tasks. Allowing employees access to Facebook and other social networking sites for business-related activities may have some benefits,
but the distractions available on the websites often outweigh any benefits.

<br>

<strong>Employee Relations</strong>
Social networking has the ability to hurt employee relations within a company. Employees may send negative messages or harass one another
through social networking sites and hinder their ability to work together. An employee who had a bad day at work may post an innocent status message
or tweet about his day and another employee may relay that information to that employee's supervisor, resulting in tension in the workplace and resentment among employees.
Additionally, social networking provides a way for employees to communicate with one another throughout the day without anyone overhearing,
leading to an increase in off-task conversation
