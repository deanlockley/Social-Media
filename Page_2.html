  <h2>Networking: Benefits of Social Media</h2>

  <strong>Notes from Author</strong>
  <p>Social Media provides a key potential benefit for professional networking, the user can specify a certain area and search for people whom are
    in this category. Sites such as LinkedIN are a good example
    of how people can connect for professional networking services with the potential to find employment or potential business
    partners through them.</p>

<strong>Quote</strong>

  <em>"Successful social media networks motivate people to engage in behaviors that speak to their most basic psychological
  needs through citizenship in a virtual society. These environments provide individuals with the ability to
  build relationships (relatedness), exercise competence, and express autonomy. Recipes for satisfying these basic
  needs are vital to the success of virtual societies." </em> (Krishen et al, 2016)

<strong>Productivity Increase </strong>
Research by the McKinsey Global Institute revealed that while 72% of companies are using social media, they are not using it to the fullest potential,
which includes the implementation of an internal SNS. If companies were to fully implement the use of social media and an SNS, they could improve employee productivity by 20% to 25%.
Research has shown that employees who are social are more comfortable communicating with others and researching customer solutions, and are more likely to
collaborate with those they are unfamiliar with in real life.

<br>
<strong>Collaboration</strong>
Social media networking encourages employees to reach out to colleagues across your organization and pose questions or start a conversation around a particular topic.
For example, let’s say you operate a call center with hundreds of customer inquiries per day. Most of the work is routine and you’ve got a script to answer the basic questions.
However, there will be a time when the question is not basic and requires more thought, more research. Well, you can’t take days to find an answer or solution. Your customer is waiting and wants it now.
If you’ve got an internal SNS, your employee can jump on the SNS and post the question and receive timely responses from fellow colleagues.
An SNS also encourages employees to work together. Sure, they may never meet in person, but they can definitely build a relationship that fosters creativity and collaboration.

<br>
<strong>Retention</strong>
Trying to keep employees motivated and engaged? Promote recognition and good performance through SNS announcements. Employees can congratulate each other,
building an environment of team work and encouraging peer-to-peer feedback. The more engaged your employees, the more likely they are to stay.
The use of social media can reduce turnover as well. Big data firm, Evolv, tracked employee performance alongside social media use and found that digital connectivity increased retention.
The study, focused on hourly workers in the U.S. and from a sample size of about 39,000, found, “The employees who used 1 to 4 social networking sites on a weekly basis stayed at their jobs longer than their peers.”
And more interesting, the “ultra-social” employees that used more than 5 social networks, had higher sales than their colleagues.

<br>
<strong>Intelligence</strong>
Social media just makes you smarter. Employees that are researching, communicating, and building online networks are some of the most involved,
innovative, and progressive-minded people you’ll find. They’re engaging in thoughtful conversations and trending as experts in their industries.
You need this knowledge in your call centers, advertising floors, and yes, even in your accounting department.
The learning opportunities you can offer with social media are endless. New perspectives and loads of good information exists on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and even your own internal SNS.
You’re looking for that competitive edge and social media can provide that in 140 characters or less.
Smart companies are quickly recognizing that social media use has become an important aspect of doing business. It has become a requirement for everyone to be social—not just the millennials you’ve hired.
It is everyone’s responsibility to find the competitive edge and drive the business forward.
