<h2>Why do Employees use social media?</h2>

<strong>Notes from Author</strong>
<p>There is limited research done on the subject of why employees use social media at work, the main example I found is from a
pew study which undertook a survey into this subject.
The details state that social media use is not the most prevalent for purely work uses often being used for personal reasons.</p>

<strong>Quote</strong>
<em>"Workers turn to social media for a range of reasons while at work, with taking a mental break being among the most common" </em> (Olmstead et al, 2016)

<br>
<br>

<strong>Content</strong>
<p>As noted above, 17% of workers say they use social media to build or strengthen personal relationships at work –
but the transparency that social media facilitates comes with costs as well as benefits.
Some 14% of workers have found information on social media that has improved their professional opinion of a colleague; at the same time, a similar share (16%)
have found information on social media that has lowered their professional opinion of a colleague. </p>

<p>Younger workers more likely to find information on social media that changes their opinion of a coworker Younger workers are more likely than
their older counterparts to say they have discovered information about a colleague on social media that lowered their professional opinion of them –
but also are more likely than older workers to have found information that improved their professional opinion of a colleague. </p>

<p>Some 23% of workers ages 18 to 29 report that they have discovered information on social media that improved their professional opinion of a colleague.
By comparison, just 12% of workers ages 30 to 49 and 9% of workers ages 50 to 64 have experienced this.
Similarly, 29% of these younger workers have discovered information that lowered their professional opinion of a colleague: 16% of those ages 30 to 49 and 6% of those ages 50 to 64 indicate that this has happened to them.</p>
