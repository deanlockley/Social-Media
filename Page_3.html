Consequently this can be used in order to positively
frame the company in order to appeal to certain demographics, Wendy’s twitter account is a good <a href="http://www.lifebuzz.com/wendys-twitter/">example of this.</a>

<h3> Increased Brand Awareness</h3>

<p><strong>Social media is one of the most cost-efficient digital marketing methods used to syndicate content and increase your business’ visibility.
Implementing a social media strategy will greatly increase your brand recognition since you will be engaging with a broad audience of consumers.</strong></p>

<p>To get started, create social media profiles for your business and begin interacting with others.
  Get employees, business partners, and sponsors to "like" and "share" your page. Simply having people interact with your content will increase brand
  awareness and begin building your reputation as a business. Each post that is shared will be introduced to a new network of individuals,
  which can lead them to becoming potential customers, and the more people who know about your business, the better. </p>

<p>By investing only a few hours per week, over 91% of marketers claimed that their social marketing efforts greatly increased their exposure.
There is no doubt that by simply having a social media page your brand will benefit, and with regular use it can generate a wide audience for your business.</p>

<h3> More Inbound Traffic </h3>

<p>Without marketing your business on social media, your inbound traffic is limited to your usual customers.
  The people familiar with your brand are likely searching for the same keywords you already rank for.
  Without utilizing social media as part of your marketing strategy, you’ll have much more difficulty reaching anyone outside of your loyal customer circle.<p>

<p><strong>Every social media profile you add to your marketing mix is a gateway to your website, and every piece of
content you post is another opportunity to acquire a new customer. Social media is a melting pot of different types of people with varying backgrounds and behaviors.
With different people come different needs and different ways of thinking.</strong></p>

<p>Syndicating your content on as many platforms as possible allows these individuals to organically reach your business. For instance, perhaps someone in an older
demographic of consumers will search for your website using a particular keyword on Facebook, but a millennial could begin their search by using a different social
media platform entirely, because they search for products totally differently. By marketing on social media you can effectively open your business to a wider
of versatile consumers all over the world.</p>

<h3> Improved Search Engine Rankings </h3>

<p>Although posting on social media might get your business some site traffic, more effort than that is required to see significant success. Search engine optimization is very important for achieving higher page rankings and obtaining traffic to your business website. While social media doesn’t directly increase search engine rankings, Social Media Examiner states that more than 58% of marketers who have been using social media for one year or longer still see improved search engine rankings. Being able to rank in the top positions for your keywords will revolutionize your traffic and continue to generate positive results for your business.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, everyone uses Google to find information, and they likely won’t navigate past page 1 because their answer normally is on the first page of results. If your business website isn’t ranked towards the top of search engine results, you should probably adjust your search engine optimization strategy.</p>

<p>To give yourself the best chance of ranking better through social media, create high quality content that integrates your targeted keywords. Content such as blogs, infographics, case studies, business information, and employee photos will make your business’s social media profile intriguing and credible. Once you begin posting quality content, you’ll begin to build a social media community where followers will "like" and "share" your content. Most importantly, it gives you more opportunities to get in front of industry influencers who will write about your business and provide links back – which will help to directly increase search engine rankings. </p>

<h3> Higher Conversion Rates </h3>

<p>With increased visibility, your business gains more opportunities for conversion. Every blog post, image, video, or comment may lead viewers to your company’s website and increase traffic. Social media marketing allows your business to give a positive impression through a humanization factor. When brands are interactive by sharing content, commenting, and posting statuses on social media, it personifies a brand. People prefer to do business with other people, rather than companies.

Over 51% of marketers claimed that taking the time to develop relationships with consumers showed positive results in sales. The better impression you make on a visitor, the more likely they are to think of your business when the need for your product or services arises.</p>

<p><strong>Studies have also shown that social media has a 100% higher lead-to-close rate than outbound marketing. When a brand is interactive online, consumers who follow your brand’s accounts often begin to more completely trust the credibility of your business.</strong></p>

<p>People use social media platforms to stay connected to their friends, family, and communities. Since people are already talking, why not throw your brand into the mix? More likely than not, they’ll mention your brand to a friend when your products or services are needed, overall providing your business with social proof of its quality. As reported by Social Media Examiner, about 66% of marketers saw lead generation benefits by using social media platforms at least 6 hours per week. Putting your brand in an atmosphere where people are sharing, liking, and talking, can only improve the conversion rates on your existing traffic. </p>

<h3> Better Customer Satisfaction </h3>

<p>Social media is a networking and communication platform. Creating a voice for your company through these platforms is important in humanizing your company. Customers appreciate knowing that when they post comments on your pages, they will receive a personalized response rather than an automated message. Being able to acknowledge each comment shows that you are attentive of your visitors’ needs and aim to provide the best experience.

Every customer interaction on your business’s social media accounts is an opportunity to publicly demonstrate your compassion for your customers.
Whether an individual has a question or a complaint, social media allows you to address the matter using interpersonal dialogue.
A brand devoted to customer satisfaction that takes the time to compose personal messages will inherently be viewed in a positive light,
even if responding to a customer complaint.</p>

<h3> Improved Brand Loyalty </h3>

<p> One of the main goals of almost all businesses is developing a loyal customer base. Considering that customer satisfaction and brand loyalty typically go hand in hand, it is important to regularly engage with consumers and begin developing a bond with them. Social media is not just limited to introducing your brand’s products and promotional campaigns. Customers see these platforms as a service channel where they can communicate directly with the business.

The millennial generation is known for being the most brand loyal customers of all. Born between the early 1980’s and the early 2000’s, millennials are the largest generation in US history -– and will soon completely consume the market.
<p><strong>Studies show that this segment of customers is 62% more loyal to brands that directly engage with them on social media. </strong></p>
<p>Since these technology natives require communication with their brands, businesses must implement social media marketing to get the attention of their most influential consumers. </p>

<h3> More Brand Authority </h3>

<p>Customer satisfaction and brand loyalty both play a part in making your business more authoritative, but it all comes down to communication.
When consumers see your company posting on social media, especially replying to customers and posting original content, it makes you appear more credible.
Regularly interacting with customers demonstrates that your business cares about customer satisfaction, and is available to answer any questions that they might have.
Satisfied customers are eager to spread the word about a great product or service and they usually turn to social media to express their opinion.
Having customers mention your business on social media will advertise your business, and show new visitors your value and brand authority.
Once you obtain a few satisfied customers who are vocal about their positive purchase experience, you can let the advertising be done for you by actual
customers who enjoyed your product or service. </p>

<h3> Cost-Effective </h3>

<p>Social media marketing is possibly the most cost-efficient part of an advertising strategy. Signing up and creating a profile is free for almost all social networking
  platforms, and any paid promotions you decide to invest in are a relatively low cost compared to other marketing tactics.
  Being cost-effective is such an advantage because you can see a greater return on investment and retain a bigger budget for other marketing and business expenses.

If you decide to use paid advertising on social media, always start small to see what you should expect. As you become more comfortable,
fine tune your strategy and try increasing your budget. Just by spending a small amount of time and money you can significantly increase your conversion
rates and eventually get return on investment on the money you initially invested.</p>

<h3> Gain Marketplace Insights </h3>

<p>One of the most valuable advantages of social media is marketplace insight. What better way to know the thoughts and needs of your consumers than by directly talking to them? By monitoring the activity on your profiles,, you can see customer’ interests and opinions that you might not otherwise be aware of if your business didn’t have a social media presence.

<p><strong>Using social media as a complementary research tool can help gain information that will aid you in understanding your industry.</strong></p>
<p>Once you gain a large following, you can use additional tools to analyze the demographics of your consumers.
Another insightful aspect of social media marketing is the ability to segment your content syndication lists based on topic, and
identify which types of content generate the most impressions. These tools give you the ability to measure conversions based on posts on various social media
platforms to find the perfect combination for generating revenue.</p>

<h3> Thought Leadership </h3>

<p>Posting insightful and well-written content on your social media is a great way to become an expert and leader in your field. There is no one way to become a thought leader – it requires work that can be supported by online networking tools. To establish yourself as an expert, be sure to utilize social media platforms and build your presence. Be communicative, connect with your audience, share content, and promote your authority. When your social media campaign is aligned with other marketing efforts, your skills will be highlighted and followers will look up to you. Being able to directly connect with your customers
creates a relationship that they will value, allowing you to become a notable influencer in your field. </p>
